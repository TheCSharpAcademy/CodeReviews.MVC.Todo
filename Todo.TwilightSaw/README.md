## Challenges and Learned Lessons
- This was my first FullStack SPA project, doing it was a real challenge and pleasure at the same time.
- It my first approach with TypeScript, so it was a lot of new things to learn and it is still a lot, lot more.
- Minimal API is really lightweight method to create API, but not as flexible as classic controllers.
- Fetch API is a neat way to get data from backend API, but I wonder is there a way to do it even better? 


## Areas to Improve
- Learn a lot more about TS and it's frameworks.
- Improve visual design with CSS, html, Bootstrap.

## Resources Used
- C# Academy guidelines and roadmap.
- ChatGPT for new information as TS, CSS, html, API.
- Various StackOverflow articles.
- Bunch of YouTube videos about CSS flex.
- MDN Web docs.
